# Sorting Functions

A collection of sorting functions, as well as an executable script to validate them, implemented in Python.

Uses an iterative loop to fill an array with random integers, and uses recursive implementations of algorithms to sort them.

## Descriptions
The sorting algorithms implemeted are explained below.

### Merge Sort
The array is initially split into two halves; these halves are then also split into halves until the 
array is a single value. Then, the two arrays are compared, index by index, and merged into a separate 
array in order from least to greatest. The arrays are sorted in this manner backwards until the initial 
split is reached, where the two arrays are merged providing a sorted solution.
